# Go download latest version of SDL for Mac (ends in .dmg, this method was tested with: SDL2-2.24.0.dmg): 
https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/

# Open a Terminal window
'COMMAND + SPACEBAR' -> search 'Terminal' and press 'Enter'

# Resolve the filename of the downloaded SDL2 package and mount it by copy pasting the command that starts 
# with hdiutil, followed by the 'Enter' key
# (alternatively you can go double click the file in your Downloads thru finder)
hdiutil attach ~/Downloads/SDL*.dmg

# Use the below command to copy SDL framework into /Library/Frameworks (make sure you only have one SDL2.*.dmg 
# in your downloads folder or this will error). 
# This is NOT the same as ~/Library/Frameworks...both can work by my code is set up to use the root version of Library (/Library, not ~/Library)
# Alternatively, you can double click the mounted SDL2 on your desktop to see the contents of the downloaded SDL2 files if they're not showing 
# already and drag the folder SDL2.framework into the 'Frameworks'folder in '/Library', but its a pain to get finder to show you the proper 
# root version of /Library: https://www.macinstruct.com/tutorials/how-to-open-the-library-folder-on-your-mac/
sudo cp -r /Volumes/SDL2/SDL2.framework /Library/Frameworks/Headers

# [optional] open the readme in TextEdit
open -a TextEdit /Volumes/SDL2/ReadMe.txt

# eject/unmount .dmg (can do this on desktop using mouse as well)
hdiutil unmount /Volumes/SDL2

# navigate to a folder where you want the downloaded folder to go
# and clone the repo for the starter code (if you haven't already)
git clone https://github.com/rosejoshua/QuickSDL2Mac.git

# go into the folder we just downloaded from github
cd QuickSDL2Mac

# [optional: take a look at the folder contents]
ls -a

# Makre sure you have Clang++ compiler. You may be able to use other compilers but I didn't test others, g++ worked but just used Clang++
clang++ -v

# if you obviously dont have Clang++ you can download XCode for Mac (kinda bloated but lots of utilities)
command xcode-select --install
# make sure you close the terminal window and open a new one to verify the 'clang++ -v' command so it can see the new install

# increase permission for our script that builds and launches the c++ app (obviously read thru the script and make sure it's not a virus :P)
chmod u+x comprun.sh

# run the below script to try and compile the c++ code, you will probably get the security error because we are trying to use downloaded SDL2 code 
# and MacOs doesn't trust it by default. Hopefully you see the popup. You then need to open 'Security and Privacy' (COMMAND + SPACEBAR -> search "security
# and privacy" and press 'Enter'). Look for the option to approve the security exception, (click the lock icon as needed to allow changes and save). Then
# try and run the script again:
./comprun.sh

#alternatively you can find 'app' in the folder in finder and double click it but the script is pretty convenient

# hopefully it works for you! You should have a pink rectangle you can move with the arrow keys...maybe more if I've added functinality to the starter code.
# Its all in one file containinig the main method, so you obviously want to start breaking it apart into classes or you'll end up with spaghetti code but
# follow your dreams! If you have issues or something is confusing, go to jrose.me/contact and send me a message or leave a comment on the YouTube video 
# for this code in my channel; https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSrxiAK9F0pyxDUpr3ETf_Q should be @jrose.me once I get enough views
