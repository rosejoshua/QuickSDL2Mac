# Go download latest version of SDL for Mac (ends in .dmg, this method was tested with: SDL2-2.24.0.dmg): 
https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/

# Grab filename and mount it (alternatively you can go double click the file in your Downloads thru finder)
hdiutil attach ~/Downloads/SDL*.dmg

# copy SDL framework into ~/Library/Frameworks (make sure you only have one SDL2.*.dmg in your downloads folder or this will error)
sudo cp -r /Volumes/SDL2/SDL2.framework /Library/Frameworks/Headers

# [optional] open the readme in TextEdit
